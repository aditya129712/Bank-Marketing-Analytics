The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be subscribed or not. 
This dataset contains 4 files.: 
1) bank-additional-full.csv with all examples (41188) and 20 inputs, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010) 
2) bank-additional.csv with 10% of the examples (4119), randomly selected from 1), and 20 inputs. 
3) bank-full.csv with all examples and 17 inputs, ordered by date (older version of this dataset with fewer inputs). 
4) bank.csv with 10% of the examples and 17 inputs, randomly selected from 3 (older version of this dataset with fewer inputs). 
The smallest datasets are provided to test more computationally demanding machine learning algorithms 
Find key metrics and factors and show the meaningful relationships between attributes.
